# Determining strong base-orderability of a matroid

<https://mathoverflow.net/questions/194006/determining-strong-base-orderability-of-a-matroid>

determining base-orderability of a matroid can be done through finding perfect matching in a bipartite graph with $\|E\|^2$ edges. call oracle $\|E\|^2$ times to build the graph and run a matching algorithm.

Is the union of strongly base-orderable matroids strongly base-orderable? yes.

also see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base-orderable_matroid#:~:text=feasible%20exchange%20bijection.-,Completeness,-%5Bedit%5D)

### difference between base-orderable and strong base orderable?

<https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05521>

an induction on the size of the set $X$

- 1-BO
- 2-BO
- ...
- $\lceil r/2 \rceil$-BO = SBO

given 2 bases of a matroid and a k-BO bijection f, find subsets with k+1 elements which do satisfy $k+1$-BO?

1-BO -> 2-BO is already hard...
