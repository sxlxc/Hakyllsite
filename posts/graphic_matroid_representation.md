**Update** The latter half of this post is way off-topic. So I changed the title.

# Graphic matroids are regular

Consider the vertex-edge incidence matrix. Randomly orient the edges. $A_{v,e}=+1$ if $e$ enters $v$, $-1$ if $e$ leaves $v$, $0$ otherwise. Minimal linear dependent columns are exactly the cycles in the original graph. Take $+1$ to be the multiplicative identity and $-1$ its additive inverse over any field.

# If $M$ is linear, so is $M^*$

> <https://fardila.com/Clase/Matroids/LectureNotes/lectures1-25.pdf> page 21

In the dual matroid $M^*$, the groundset is the same as $M$ and the sum of their ranks is $n$.

The idea is, consider a linear matroid as a $r$ dimensional subspace $V$ in $\R^n$. Let $B^*$ be a basis of $M(V^\bot)$ ($V^\bot$ is the orthogonal complement of the column space of $V$) and $B$ be a basis of $M(V)$.
$B^*$ spans $V^\bot$ and the intersection of $V^\bot$ and the subspace spanned by vectors (that is $V$) in $E-B^*$ empty. The subspace spanned by $B^*$ is exactly the orthogonal complement of $V$ which is the subspace spanned by $B$.

An alternative proof is <https://math.mit.edu/~goemans/18438F09/lec8.pdf> Theorem 2.

This argument works over any field.
Thus both graphic matroids and cographic matroids are regular.

# Cographic matroids

Cycle rank is the minimum number of edges whose removal makes the graph cycle less.
For any spanning forest $F$, all edges outside $F$ must be removed since otherwise there will be a cycle.
The size of spanning forests are the same, i.e. $n-c$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $c$ is the number of components. Thus cycle rank is the rank of the dual matroid of the graphic matroid on $G$. 

For graphic matroids on non-planar graphs, their dual may not be graphic. Thus in general we do not have a graph representation of cographic matroids. However, cographic matroids are still linear and cycle space gives its representation.

Edge space is a vector space over $\F_2$. Elements in the edge space of $G=(V,E)$ are subsets of $E$. Addition of two elements is taking their symmetric difference. Bases in the edge space are spanning forests and the rank of edge space is $n-c$.

Cycle space is naturally defined as the vector space spanned by all cycles (together with $\emptyset$). What is the rank of the cycle space? The rank is exactly $m-(n-c)$ since if we fix a spanning forest $F$ (of size $n-c$) any edge outside $F$ form a cycle and those cycles are linearly independent. The basis chosen in this way is called a *fundamental cycle basis*. Indeed, the cycle space can be spanned with all induced cycles.

Cut space contains all cuts of the graph(why is this a subspace?). One possible basis of the cut space is $\text{star}(v)$ for any $n-c$ vertices. Thus the rank of the cut space is $n-c$. The set of minimal cuts also span the cut space. One may observe the fact that the sum of ranks of cut space and cycle space is $m$. In fact, they are orthogonal complement of each other. For proofs see chapter 1.9 in [@diestel_graph_2017].

One important fact we are assuming is that cycle space and cut space are subspaces. This is trivial for graphic matroids since the symmetric difference of two cuts is still a cut and the symmetric difference of two cycle is still a cycle of union of disjoint cycles. Is this still true for non-graphic matroids?

Unfortuantely, for general matroids the set of circuit (or cocircuits) is not closed under taking symmetric difference. This can be seen from circuit axioms. We only have $C\subset C_1 \cup C_2\setminus e$ for any circuit $C_1, C_2$ and $e\in C_1\cap C_2$. For example, consider two circuits $\set{1,2,3}$ and $\set{2,3,4}$ in $U_{2,4}$, the symmetric difference, $\set{1,4}$, is independent.

Note that the example $U_{2,4}$ is the excluded minor of binary matroids. So what about binary matroids? It is known that binary matroid is a self dual family of matroids, we need to show that the symmetric difference of two intersecting circuits is another circuit. This is theorem 9.1.2 in [@oxley_matroid_2011].

A similar problem is discussed on [mathoverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/241766/base-decomposition-of-matroids) concerning a special basis (like $\text{star}(v)$) in the "cocircuit space". I will further elaborate in the next section.

# Cocircuit transversal

In the comment the OP mentioned a interesting fact, which is corollary 1 in [@brualdi_fundamental_1974]

::: Corollary
Given a base $B$ of some rank $r$ matroid $M$. Let $\mathcal C^*=\set{C_e^* | e\in B}$ be the set of fundamental cocircuits associated to $B$. Every base of $M$ is a transversal of $\mathcal C^*$.
:::

An alternative way to understand this is that, take a base $B$ of some matroid $M$ and consider the transversal matroid on $\set{C_e^* | e\in B}$, every base of $M$ is independent in this transversal matroid. Take graphic matroids for an example. Any edge $e$ in a spanning tree $T$ defines a unique cut. Any spanning tree is a transversal of these cuts. 

> I tried to prove this corollary myself but failed. The following proof is from the paper. 
> I think there should be a nice way to prove it directly (without the theorem below) through some "common transversal proof" techniques I am not familiar with.

To simplify the notations, some definitions in [@brualdi_fundamental_1974] are needed. For a base $B$, let $C_e^*$ be the unique cocircuit in $e\cup E\setminus B$ if $e$ is in $B$. For $e\notin B$, let $C_e^*$ be $\{e\}$. Dually, for a fixed base $B$ and $e\notin B$, we can define $C_e$ to be the unique circuit in $E$ and $C_e=\{e\}$ for $e\in B$. There is an interesting theorem in [@brualdi_fundamental_1974].

::: Theorem
Given any matroid $M$ with groundset $E$ and rank $r$, consider any base $B$ and any size $r$ subset $F\subset E$, $F$ is a transversal of $\{C_e^* | e\in B\}$ if and only if $B$ is a transversal of $\{C_e | e\in F\}$.
:::

> $C_e^*$ and $C_e$ are both considered under the base $B$.

::: Proof
1. $B$ is a transversal of $\{C_e | e\in F\}$. We can write $B$ as $\{b_e | b_e \in C_e ,\forall e\in F\}$ since $B$ is a system of distinct representatives. For $e\in B\cap F$, $b_e=e$ since $C_e$'s are singletons for these $e$. Thus if we can show that $e\in C_{b_e}^*$ for all $b_e\in B\setminus F$ then we finish this half. $e$ must be in $C_{b_e}^*$ since otherwise the intersection of $C_{b_e}^*$ and $C_e$ is $\{b_e\}$ and it is known that the intersection of any circuit and cocircuit in a matroid is never going to be a singleton.
2. $F$ is a transversal of $\{C_e^* | e\in B\}$. $F$ is $\{f_e | f_e \in C_e^* ,\forall e\in B\}$. And again we can ignore the intersection and prove $e\in C_{f_e}$ for $f_e\in F\setminus E$. The proof is identical.
:::

So what if $F$ is another base? We can get the corollary if we show that the base $B$ is a transversal of $\{C_e | e\in F\}$ for any other base $F\not = B$. Finally, here is the proof of the corollary.

::: Proof
By contradiction. 
Suppose that there is a base $B$ which is not a transversal of $\{C_e | e\in F\}$. 
Then by Hall's theorem there exists a independent set $I\subset F$ such that $|I|>|\bigcup_{e\in I} C_e\cap B|$. Note that $C_e$'s are fundamental circuits of $B$. Thus $\bigcup_{e\in I} C_e\cap B$ is the largest independent set in the cycle $\cup_{e\in I} C_e$. A contradiction.
