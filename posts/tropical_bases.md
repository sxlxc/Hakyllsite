In the post the author describes an interesting problem,

::: Problem
Given a matroid $M=(E,\mathcal{I})$, find a minimal set of circuits that defines the matroid
:::

The way he consider this problem is not by looking at the circuits but the flats. Any circuit excludes some sets from being flats. If we are given a circuit $c$, any set $A$ that contains $|c|-1$ elements of $c$ can not be a flat of $M$. So the idea is to find a minimal set of circuits that excludes all non-flat sets of $M$.


### combinatorial definition

A circuit $c$ ***excludes*** a set $A$ if exactly one element of $c$ is not in $A$. 
A collection of circuits $\mathcal{C}'\subseteq \mathcal{C}(M)$ is a **tropical basis** of $M$ if for every non-flat set $A$ there is a circuit $c\in \mathcal{C}'$ that excludes $A$.
The problem is then to find a minimal tropical basis of $M$.

### algebraic geometry view

Tropical basis originally comes from algebraic geometry, see [tropical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry). 
The **min tropical semiring** is the semiring $(\R\cup \{+\infty\},\oplus,\otimes)$, $x\oplus y = \min\{x,y\}$ and $x\otimes y = x+y$. The identity element for $\oplus$ is $+\infty$ and for $\otimes$ is $0$.
The **tropical variety** of a tropical polynomial is the set of points where the polynomial achieves its minimum value at least twice.

Tropical variety of a linear tropical polynomial is called **tropical hyperplane**.

For any set $A\subseteq E$ there is a natural representation of $A$ as a vector in $\{0,+\infty\}^{|E|}$, where the $i$-th coordinate is $0$ if $i\in A$ and $+\infty$ otherwise.(This is very similar to the indicator vector of a set in $\{0,1\}^n$. If the $i$-th element exists in the given set we put the identity element of $\otimes$ and otherwise the identity element of $\oplus$.)
Then we can define a linear tropical polynomial associated with a circuit $c$ just like the dot product of two vectors in $\R^n$. For example consider a circuit $c=\{1,2,3\}$ in $U_{2,4}$, $f_{c}(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)=(0 \otimes x_1)\oplus(0 \otimes x_2)\oplus(0 \otimes x_3)\oplus(+\infty\otimes x_4)$.

Denote the tropical hyperplane of a circuit $c$ by $T(c)$. $T(c)$ is the space of all vectors $v$ where $f_c(v)$ achieves its minimum at least twice. $T(\mathcal C)=\bigcap_{c\in \mathcal C}T(c)$ is the set of $v$ excluded by all circuits in $\mathcal C$.
A set $\mathcal{C}'\subseteq \mathcal C(M)$ is a **tropical basis** for matroid $M$ if $T(\mathcal C')=T(\mathcal C)$.

### connections between the two definitions

Combinatorial definition. $\mathcal C'\subseteq \mathcal C$ is a tropical basis if for every non-flat set $A$ there is a circuit $c\in \mathcal C'$ that excludes $A$.

Algebraic definition. $\mathcal C'\subseteq \mathcal C$ is a tropical basis if $T(\mathcal C')=T(\mathcal C)$.


> **Lemma** For any $\mathcal C'\subseteq \mathcal C$, $T(\mathcal C')= T(\mathcal C)$ if and only if $T(\mathcal C')\cap \{0,1\}^n= T(\mathcal C)\cap \{0,1\}^n$


This lemma shows that we can only consider the indicator vectors when dealing with the algebraic definition.

Note that $\mathcal{C}$ excludes all non-flat sets of $M$. Thus our combinatorial definition is equivalent to $\mathcal C'$ excluding the same sets as $\mathcal C$. Let $\overline{T}(c)$ be the collection of sets which are not excluded by $C$. Then $\mathcal C'$ is a tropical basis if and only if $\overline{T}(\mathcal C')=\overline{T}(\mathcal C)$. Now we consider the algebraic definition. One can see that for any non-loop circuit $c$ and set $A$, $A\notin T(c)$(in other words, $f_c(A)$ achieves its minimum only once), if and only if $c$ excludes $A$. Thus $T(\mathcal C)$ is the collection of all sets that are not excluded by any of the circuits in $\mathcal C$. Now it is easy to see that these two definitions are equivalent.



**current status** It seems that [Bergman fan](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/278264/definition-of-the-bergman-fan) of a matroid is related to this topic. <https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0411260>
This seems to be a bridge between matroid theory and algebraic geometry. June Huh's work is also related to this topic. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2519>
