<h3 data-number="1" id="projective-plane"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> projective plane</h3>
<p>some results from <a href="https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahbdo/FiniteProjectivePlanes.pdf">https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahbdo/FiniteProjectivePlanes.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Definition 2.1. A Projective plane P is an ordered pair of sets
(p(P), l(P)), whose elements are called points and lines, respectively,
and a relation between these sets, called incidence, satisfying the
following axioms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Given any two distinct points, there is exactly one line incident
with both of them.</li>
<li>Given any two distinct lines, there is exactly one point incident
with both of them.</li>
<li>There are four points such that no line is incident with more than
two of them. We say that a projective plane is finite if the number of
points of the plane is finite.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>points are vertices and lines are hypergraph edges. The axioms are
saying</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>for any two vertives there is exactly one edge contain them.</li>
<li>for any two edges their intersection is one vertex.</li>
<li>you can find 4 vertices in the hypergraph that no edge contains more
than 2 of them.</li>
</ol>
<p>the smallest projective plane is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane">Fano plane</a></p>

<!-- *a larger example from [math se](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2262517/projective-plane-of-uniformity-4)* -->
<p><strong>Theorem 2.5.</strong> for any point in the projective plane,
the number of lines incident is the same</p>
<strong>proof</strong>: take <span class="math inline">\(a\in P\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(l\in L\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(a\not\in l\)</span>, by axiom 1 one can see that
for any point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> there is a unique line incident with
both <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, thus the number of lines incident with
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the same as the number of
points on <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. then take another
point <span class="math inline">\(b\in P\)</span> and consider <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> in the same way. <span class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span> always exist and guaranteed to be
different by aixiom 3. Hence the number of lines incident with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> = # lines incident with <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = # points on <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>.

</div>
<p>by duality similar theorem holds for lines.</p>
<p>suppose the number of lines incident with every point is <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span>, then define the order of the
projective plane to be <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>One can see that the number of lines and points on a projective plane
are the same. Suppose the order of the projective plane is <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and there will be <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span> lines incident with each point and on
each line there will be <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span> points.
Thus the number of lines is <span class="math inline">\((k+1)n/(k+1)=n\)</span>, the same as points.</p>
<p>Theorem 2.5. means the corresponding hypergraph must be <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span>-uniform and <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span>-regular</p>
<p>For special(satisfying the above 3 conditions) <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span>-uniform <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span>-regular hypergraph we easily know the
number of edges and vertices is <span class="math inline">\(k(k+1)+1\)</span>, so order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> projective plane has exactly <span class="math inline">\(n^2+n+1\)</span> points and lines.</p>
<p>However not all order is possible. All known order of projective
plane is prime power. The existence of finite projective planes of other
orders is an open question. see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane#Finite_projective_planes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane#Finite_projective_planes</a></p>
<h3 data-number="2" id="mutually-orthogonal-latin-squaresmols"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Mutually orthogonal Latin
squares(MOLS)</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square">Latin square</a>
is just sudoku without the property of no repeated values in any of the
nine blocks. Latin squares can be of size <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> not just <span class="math inline">\(9\times 9\)</span>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_orthogonal_Latin_squares">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_orthogonal_Latin_squares</a></p>
<p>There is a thick book about this topic. <a href="http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/77164/1/2.pdf"><em>Latin
Squares and their application</em></a> see chapter 5.2 for details about
MOLS and projective planes.</p>
<p>from now on we only consider Latin squares of the same size.</p>
<p>Given two <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> Latin
squares <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, make a new <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> square <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>(called Graeco-Latin square or Euler
square or pair of orthogonal Latin squares). <span class="math inline">\(C[i,j]\)</span> is an ordered pair of <span class="math inline">\(A[i,j]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B[i,j]\)</span>. If there are no two cells in
<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> contains the same ordered pair,
then the two latin squares are called orthogonal.</p>
<p>A set of Latin squares are orthogonal if and only if they are
pairwise orthogonal.</p>
<p>Denote a set of <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span>
mutually orthogonal Latin squares by <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{MOLS}}(n)\)</span>. I am
insterested in <span class="math inline">\(|\mathop{\mathrm{MOLS}}(n)|\)</span>.</p>
<p>One can see that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathop{\mathrm{MOLS}}(n)| \leq n-1\)</span>
since … well i don’t know how to prove this. I find a proof from <a href="http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/77164/1/2.pdf"><em>Latin
Squares and their application</em></a>.</p>

<h4 data-number="2.1" id="how-is-mols-related-to-projective-planes"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> How is MOLS related to
projective planes?</h4>
<p>The question, for which <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\max |\mathop{\mathrm{MOLS}}(n)|=n-1\)</span> is
still open.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 5.2.2</strong> Every finite projective plane of order
n defines at least one complete set of MOLS of order n; and conversely a
complete set of MOLS of order n defines a finite projective plane</p>
<p><strong>proof</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>projective plane =&gt; MOLS. Consider an order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> projective plane and choose one line
<span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. There will be <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> lines on <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, say they are <span class="math inline">\(x,b_1,...,b_{n-1},y\)</span>. For any point there
will be <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> lines incident with it.
Denote <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> lines(other than <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>) incident with <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(b_{i1},...,b_{in}\)</span>. Denote these lines
incident with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>(or <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>) by <span class="math inline">\(x_1,...,x_n\)</span>. Note that for any two points
on the projective plane there will be exactly one line incident with
both of them. Consider one of the <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> points <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> other than <span class="math inline">\(x,b_1,...,b_{n-1},y\)</span>. There will <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> lines incident with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and there are <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> points on <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> can be identified with the ordered
tuple <span class="math inline">\(i,s_1,...,s_{n-1},j\)</span> of lines
incident with both some <span class="math inline">\(p\in
\{x,b_1,...,b_{n-1},y\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. We write <span class="math inline">\(s_k\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span>th place of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th Latin square. One can easily verify
that this construction guarantees a MOLS of size <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>.</li>
<li>MOLS =&gt; projective plane. Juse the inverse of the previous
construction. Not hard to see the resulting structure is an order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> projective plane.</li>

<h3 data-number="3" id="truncated-projective-plane"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> truncated projective plane</h3>
<p>Truncated projective plane is just a projective plane removing one
point and all lines incident with that point.</p>
<p>The interesting property is that if considered as hypergraphs
truncated projective plane of order <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(r+1\)</span>-partite hypergraph and each line
intersects with every other lines.</p>
<p><strong>proof</strong>: The <span class="math inline">\(r+1\)</span>-partites are exactly those sets of
vertices on the deleted edges. They are disjoint since otherwise there
will be two edges contains two common vertices. One can see that if one
edge contains two vertices in the same part, this edge should be exactly
the edge contains all vertices in this part and thus it should have been
deleted. So no edge contains more than 1 vertex in one part.</p>
<p>The min vertex cover is <span class="math inline">\(r-1\)</span>
since all vertices in one partite are needed.</p>
<p>The fractional matching(hitting set) = fractional vertex cover(edge
packing) = <span class="math inline">\(r-1\)</span> if we assign <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{r-1}\)</span> to every hyperedge. (note:
they are dual)</p>
<p>So for truncated projective planes the packing-cogirth gap is really
large.</p>
<h3 data-number="4" id="rysers-conjecture"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryser%27s_conjecture">Ryser’s
conjecture</a></h3>
<p>For hitting sets and edge packing in hypergraphs, one can see that
<br> max edge packing(<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>) &lt;=
max fractional edge packing(<span class="math inline">\(\tau*\)</span>)
= min fractional hitting set(<span class="math inline">\(\lambda*\)</span>) &lt;= min hitting set(<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>)</p>
<p>moreover for <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-uniform
hypergraphs, it is easy to see that <span class="math inline">\(r\tau\geq \lambda\)</span>.</p>
<p>Ryser’s conjecture says for <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-uniform <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-parite hypergraphs <span class="math inline">\((r-1)\tau \geq \lambda\)</span>. It has not been
proven yet.</p>
<p>There is another Ryser-Brualdi-Stein conjecture about size of
transversals in Latin squares. recent work on arxiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19779.pdf" class="uri">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19779.pdf</a></p>
<p>Matroid bases can be considered as edges of uniform hypergraphs. For
which kind of matroid the corresponding hypergraph has a small
upperbound for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda/\tau\)</span>?</p>
