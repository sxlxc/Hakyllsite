[This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11131) showed that it is NP-hard to approximate the girth of a binary matroid within any constant factor. This is part of a [FOCS'25 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02636).

- [John David Arellano's thesis](https://repository.rice.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/fc35cd26-2e6e-42b0-a858-8bc43ef776ba/content) on computing linear matroid girth (mostly on computational parts)
- [This mathoverflow question](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/445542/properties-of-the-girth-function-of-a-matroid) asked about approximations of matroid girth.
