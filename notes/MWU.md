This is a note on multiplicative weight update (MWU) method.

I read about MWU methods on 2 problems, finding the $k$-edge-connected spanning subgraph with smallest weight ($k$-ECSS) [@chalermsook_approximating_2022] and the minimum $k$-cut [@Quanrud_2019]. It seems that there are some connections in these two problems since both paper discover $(2+\epsilon)$ approximation algorithms in nearly linear time with MWU.
